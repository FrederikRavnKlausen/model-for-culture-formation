Various code and files for the paper "Stochastic cellular automaton model of culture formation" by F. R. Klausen and A. B. Lauritsen, [Phys. Rev. E 108, 054307 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.108.054307)

The repository is structed as follows:

The folder "auxiliary-files" contains
1. files with the geographical features used in the simulations on the European map.
2. A zip-file of all the historical maps.

The folder "plotting-code" contains code to make various plots in the paper.

The folder "simulation-code" contains the code running the simulations:
1.	The files "mapdynamics_periodic_iter---.py" run on the European map.
2.	The files "torus---.py" run on the torus, i.e., with periodic boundary conditions.
